#  Haptic Experience

Haptic Experience is a simple app built for the users to try and feel different haptics effects provided on Apple devices via UIKit and CoreHaptics frameworks.

For CoreHaptics demonstrations it uses code and resources from several Apple sample projects:

* [Haptic Sampler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/playing_a_custom_haptic_pattern_from_a_file)
* [Haptic Pallete](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/updating_continuous_and_transient_haptic_parameters_in_real_time)
* [Haptic Bounce](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corehaptics/playing_collision-based_haptic_patterns)

App Icon was made by prettycons and was taken from https://www.flaticon.com

The App is not meant for commercial use and was made purely for demonstration purposes by Alexander Danilov at Yandex.
